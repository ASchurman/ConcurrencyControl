Understanding Locking and OCC
------------------------------

Before beginning this assignment, please be sure you have a clear understanding of the goals and challenges of concurrency control mechanisms in database systems. The paper you read for class (http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs637/franklin97concurrency.pdf) provides a good introduction to this material.

In this assignment you will be implementing four concurrency control schemes:
  * two versions of locking schemes, both of which are considerably simpler than standard two-phase locking
  * a version of OCC very similar to the serial-validation version described in the OCC paper you read for class (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/cis650/papers/opt-cc.pdf)
  * a version of OCC somewhat similar to the parallel-validation version described in the OCC paper

---------
Framework
---------

You'll be implementing these concurrency control schemes within a transaction processing framework that implements a simple, main-memory resident key-value store. This is a prototype system designed specially for this assignment, and may not be 100% perfect, so please watch for class emails in the coming weeks, as parts of this assignment may change slightly. Please report any bugs or problems to Christina.

To setup our framework, simply download and extract 'hw2.tar.gz'. You'll see that it contains two subdirectories---'txn' and 'utils'. Nearly all of the source files you need to worry about are in the 'txn' subdirectory, though you might need to occasionally take a peek at a file or two in the 'util' subdirectory.

To build and test the system, you can run

  make test

at any time. This will first compile the system; if this succeeds with no errors, it will also run two test scripts: one which performs some basic correctness tests of your lock manager implementation, and a second which profiles performance of the system. This second one takes a couple of minutes to run, but you can cancel it at any time by pressing ctrl-C.

Your submissions will be graded on code style and clarity as well correctness and efficiency. When implementing your solutions, please:
  * Adhere to the Google c++ style guide when implementing your solutions. Before submitting, please ensure that
      ./hw2_lint txn/*
    finds 0 errors.
  * Comment your header files & code thoroughly in the manner demonstrated in the rest of the framework.
  * Organize your code logically.
  * Use descriptive variable names.
  * Use vertical and horizontal whitespace meaningfully and consistently.

In this assignment, you will need to make changes to the following files/classes/methods:

  txn/lock_manager.cc:
    all methods (aside for the constructor and deconstructor) for classes 'LockManagerA' (Part 1A) and 'LockManagerB' (Part 1B)

  txn/txn_processor.cc:
    'TxnProcessor::RunOCCScheduler' method (Part 2)
    'TxnProcessor::RunOCCParallelScheduler' method (Part 3)

However, to understand what's going on in the framework, you will need to look through most of the files in the txn/ directory. We suggest looking first at the TxnProcessor object (txn/txn_processor.h) and in particular the 'TxnProcessor::RunSerialScheduler()' method (txn/txn_processor.cc) and examining how it interacts with various objects in the system.

You may also want to add additional transaction types and unit tests to verify the correctness of your solution and further test its performance characteristics.

You may also want to look through the various test scripts (txn/*_test.cc) to see how they're set up. Try adding a new test to one of these scripts to get familiar with the test framework, and see what happens when it passes or fails.

Note: The framework relies heavily on the C++ standard template library (STL). If you have any questions about how to use the STL (it's really quite easy and friendly, I promise), please consult your search engine of choice.

----------------------------------------------
Part 1A: Simple Locking (exclusive locks only)
----------------------------------------------

Once you've looked through the code and are somewhat familiar with the overall structure and flow, you'll implement a simplified version of two-phase locking. The protocol goes like this:

1) Upon entering the system, each transaction requests an EXCLUSIVE lock on EVERY item that it will either read or write.
2) Wait until ALL locks are granted. This might be immediately, or the transaction might have to wait for earlier transactions to release their locks on the relevant keys.
3) Execute program logic.
4) Release ALL locks at commit/abort time.

Two additional rules:
A) Transactions must submit their entire set of lock requests ATOMICALLY. This means that if any of Txn A's lock requests is submitted before some lock request of Txn B, then ALL of Txn A's lock requests must be submitted before ANY of Txn B's. In practice, we do this by having a single thread do all concurrency control work.
B) Each lock must be granted to transactions in the order that they requested it. So if Txn A and Txn B both requested a lock on the record with key "X", and A was the first to request the lock, then A must also be the first to be granted the lock.

Note that the transaction's read and write sets are always declared up front in 'Txn::readset_' and 'Txn::writeset_'. When executing, txns are allowed to read records whose keys appear in EITHER its readset or its writeset, and it may write records whose keys appear in writeset.

To help you get comfortable using the transaction processing framework, most of this algorithm is already implemented in 'TxnProcessor::RunScheduler1()'. Locks are requested and released at all the right times, and all necessary data structures for an efficient lock manager are already in place. All you need to do is implement the 'WriteLock', 'Release', and 'Status' methods in the class 'LockManagerA'.

The test file 'txn/lock_manager_test.cc' provides some rudimentary correctness tests for your lock manager implementations, but additional tests may be added when we grade the assignment. We therefore suggest that you augment the tests with any additional cases you can think of that the existing tests do not cover.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1B: Slightly Less Simple Locking (adding in shared locks)
--------------------------------------------------------------

To increase concurrency, we can allow transactions with overlapping readsets but disjoing writesets to execute concurrently. We do this by adding in SHARED locks. Again, all data structures already exist, and all you need to implement are the 'WriteLock', 'ReadLock', 'Release', and 'Status' methods in the class 'LockManagerB'.

Again, 'txn/lock_manager_test.cc' profides some basic correctness tests, but you should go beyond these in checking the correctness of your implementation.

---------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Serial Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)
---------------------------------------------------

For OCC, you will have to implement the 'TxnProcessor::RunOCCScheduler' method. To test the correctness of your OCC implementation, you may want to add one or more new tests to txn/txn_processor_test.cc, but these should not be submitted.

This is a simplified version of OCC compared to the one presented in the paper.

Pseudocode for the OCC algorithm to implement (in the RunOCCScheduler method):

  while (true) {
    Get the next new transaction request (if one is pending) and start it running.
    Deal with all transactions that have finished running.
  }

  Starting a transaction:
    Record start time.
    Start transaction running in its own thread.

  Dealing with a finished transaction:
    // Validation phase:
    for (each record whose key appears in the txn's read and write sets) {
      if (the record was last updated AFTER this transaction's start time) {
        Validation fails!
      }
    }
    // Commit/restart
    if (validation failed) {
      Completely restart the transaction.
    } else {
      Apply all writes.
      Mark transaction as committed.
    }

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 3: Optimistic Concurrency Control with Parallel Validation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

OCC with parallel validation means that the validation step for OCC is done in parallel. There are several different ways to do the parallel validation -- here we give a simplified version of the pseudocode from the paper, or you can write your own pseudocode based on the paper's presentation of parallel validation and argue why it's better than the ones presented here (see analysis question 4).  

The util/atomic.h file contains data structures that may be useful for this section.

Pseudocode to implement in RunOCCParallelScheduler:
Note: For this pseudocode, it is up to you to decide the values of n and m that will be most effective.

  while (true) {
    Get the next new transaction request (if one is pending) and start it running.
    Deal with n transactions that have finished running.
    Deal with m transactions that have finished the validation phase.
  }

  Starting a transaction:
    Record start time.
    Start transaction running in its own thread.

  Dealing with a finished transaction:
    Make a copy of the active set save it/pass it to the validation phase
    Add this transaction to the active set
    Start validation phase running in its own thread.

  Validation phase:
    for (each record whose key appears in the txn's read and write sets) {
      if (the record was last updated AFTER this transaction's start time) {
        Validation fails!
      }
    }
    for (each txn t in the txn's copy of the active set) {
      if (txn's write set intersects with t's read or write sets) {
        Validation fails!
      }
    }
    if valid : write
    Add txn to list of transactions that have finished the validation phase; save whether it's valid or not.

  Post-validation phase:
    Remove this transaction from the active set
    // Commit/restart
    if (validation failed) {
      Completely restart the transaction.
    } else {
      Mark transaction as committed.
      Cleanup.
    }
